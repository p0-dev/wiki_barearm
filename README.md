This series of document describe the bare metal architecture of basic ARM 
micro-processor. This includes various subject such as:
- ARM architecture memory layout and memory mapping
- Linker script
- Boot sequence
- Boot file
- Code sections
- Simulation of ARM architecture with QEMU

The series is still lack of certain topics such as:
- Dive deep into the use / purpose and technical aspect of CRT0.o file
(from both general purpose from Toolchain and specific from MUC manufacturer)
- Preparing the C Run-time environment for executing C source code on 
different targets (MCU targets)
